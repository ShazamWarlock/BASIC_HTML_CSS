            Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini is an Argentine professional
            footballer who plays as a forward and captains both Spanish club
            Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best
            player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest
            players of all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or
            awards,[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes. He has spent
            his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he has won a
            club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, four UEFA
            Champions League titles and six Copas del Rey. A prolific goalscorer
            and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in
            La Liga (438), a La Liga and European league season (50), most
            hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and
            most assists in La Liga (181) and the Copa América (12). He has
            scored over 700 senior career goals for club and country.

            An Argentine international, Messi is his country's all-time leading
            goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth
            Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and
            Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics.
            His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew
            comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi
            as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi
            became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup
            during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa
            América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the
            squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three
            consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the
            Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copas América. After announcing
            his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and
            led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and a
            third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América.

            Following on from their poor qualification campaign, salvaged by Messi,
            expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team,
            without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018. Prior to
            Argentina's opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this
            would be Messi's final World Cup.In the team's opening group match
            against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning
            penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw.In Argentina's second game of the 2018
            World Cup on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia. Post match the
            Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team
            surrounding Messi, "the reality of the Argentina squad clouds his
            [Messi's] brilliance". Messi had just 49 touches of the ball and only
            two inside the Croatia penalty area. Sampaoli stated, "we quite simply
            couldn't pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to.
            We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to
            prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle." Croatia
            midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, "Messi is an incredible
            player but he can't do everything alone."

            In Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky
            Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in
            an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego
            Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups;
            he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens,
            twenties, and his thirties. A goal of the tournament contender, Messi
            received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run
            with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his
            weaker right foot. Argentina progressed to the second round as group
            runners-up behind Croatia. In the round of 16 match against eventual
            champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio
            Agüero's goals in a 4–3 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the
            World Cup. With his two assists in his team's second round fixture,
            Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four
            World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a
            match for Argentina since Diego Maradona had managed the same feat
            against South Korea in 1986.

          <p class="para">
            Following the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in
            Argentina's friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September 2018,
            and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his
            nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi's absence from the
            national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina
            prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from
            international football once again. In March 2019, however, he was called
            up to the Argentina squad once again for the team's friendlies against
            Venezuela and Morocco later that month. He made his international return
            on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.
