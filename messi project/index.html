    <h1 class="bord">LIONEL ANDRES MESSI</h1>

    <p>
      Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini is an Argentine professional footballer who
      plays as a forward and captains both Spanish club Barcelona and the
      Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and
      widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won
      a record six Ballon d'Or awards,[note 2] and a record six European Golden
      Shoes. He has spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where
      he has won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, four
      UEFA Champions League titles and six Copas del Rey. A prolific goalscorer
      and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La
      Liga (438), a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in
      La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La
      Liga (181) and the Copa América (12). He has scored over 700 senior career
      goals for club and country.

    <h2>National Glory</h2>

    <p>
      An Argentine international, Messi is his country's all-time leading
      goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship,
      finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an
      Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a
      diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot
      Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior
      debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and
      score in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final
      of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the
      tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to
      three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the
      Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copas América. After announcing his
      international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his
      country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and a third-place
      finish at the 2019 Copa América.

    <h2>2018 World Cup</h2>

    <p>
      Following on from their poor qualification campaign, salvaged by Messi,
      expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team,
      without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018. Prior to
      Argentina's opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this
      would be Messi's final World Cup.In the team's opening group match against
      Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an
      eventual 1–1 draw.In Argentina's second game of the 2018 World Cup on 21
      June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia. Post match the Argentina coach Jorge
      Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, "the
      reality of the Argentina squad clouds his [Messi's] brilliance". Messi had
      just 49 touches of the ball and only two inside the Croatia penalty area.
      Sampaoli stated, "we quite simply couldn't pass to him to help him
      generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but
      the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We
      lost that battle." Croatia midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match,
      "Messi is an incredible player but he can't do everything alone."
    </p>

    <p>
      In Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky
      Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an
      eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona
      and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also
      became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties,
      and his thirties. A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a
      long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two
      touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right
      foot. Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind
      Croatia. In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30
      June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio Agüero's goals in a 4–3
      defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup. With his two
      assists in his team's second round fixture, Messi became the first player
      to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the
      first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Diego
      Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in
      Argentina's friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September 2018,
      and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation
      for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi's absence from the national
      team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted
      speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international
      football once again. In March 2019, however, he was called up to the
      Argentina squad once again for the team's friendlies against Venezuela and
      Morocco later that month. He made his international return on 22 March, in
      a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.

    <h2>The Scientifically Impossible Goal</h2>

    <p>
      Messi’s goal against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa Del Rey will defiantly be
      remembered as one of his best ever. It was an awe-inspiring move by him
      which saw him leave 4 Bilbao defenders for dead and then releasing a
      strike with deadly accuracy, beating Bilbao goalkeeper Herrin at the near
      post.
    </p>

    <p>
      Messi’s initial run was clocked at a speed of 31.38 Km/h and he took only
      2.73 seconds to reach that speed and mind the fact that he had ball under
      his feet as well. When the 3 Bilbao defenders surrounded him, he
      decelerates and makes 3 short touches to beat all of them which took him
      only 1.2 seconds. Then cuts into the box where he shimmies past Laporte,
      this shimmy gave him 5 feet of space from which he released a shot with
      deadly accuracy at a velocity of 77.24 Km/h.
    </p>

    <p>
      The whole move happened in a shocking 11.4 seconds. Another incredible
      fact is that in the whole move that covered nearly 60 yards, the ball was
      2 feet away from Messi for barely 2 seconds. The strike had to be so
      precise that if it was the point of contact was 1.5MM towards the right or
      left, he would have missed the shot.
    </p>

    <h2>91 goals in 1 season</h2>
    <p>
      The record for most number of goals scored in a calendar year. He scored
      91 official goals in 2012, 84 with Barcelona (59 in the League, 13 in the
      Champions League, 5 in the Copa del Rey and 2 in the Super Cup) and 12
      with the Argentine national team.During the calendar year, Leo scored a
      record 91 goals combined in all competitions for Barcelona and the
      Argentina national side, shattering the mark of 85 tallied by Gerd Muller
      for Bayern Munich and Germany in 1972.
    </p>

    <h2>GOAT Figures</h2>
    <p>
      Barcelona’s number 10, Messi has already recorded the most titles (34),
      most wins, most goals (672) and most assists (288) for the Catalan giants
      in the 121-year old history of the La Liga powerhouse. Messi is the only
      footballer to win four prestigious awards — Ballon d’Or, FIFA World
      Player, Pichichi Trophy and Golden Boot – in a single season. He achieved
      the feat during the 2009/10 campaign. He is the only player to win six
      Ballon d’Or (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2019) awards in the history
      of the game. The second spot on this list is reserved by Portuguese great
      Cristiano Ronaldo, who has won the prestigious trophy five times. Messi is
      the only footballer to win six Golden Shoes. He was awarded the accolade
      in 2009-10, 2011-12, 2012-13, 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons. Messi
      holds the record for being the youngest player to score 100 goals for
      Barcelona in official matches. He achieved the feat in 2010 and at that
      time he was just 22-year-old. Messi was the youngest player to net 200
      goals for Barca. Messi also holds the record for the most number of goals
      in a singles calendar year. In 2012, Messi scored 91 goals — 79 with Barça
      (59 in La Liga, 13 in the Champions League, 5 in the Copa del Rey and 2 in
      the Spanish Super Cup) and 12 for Argentina. He also holds the record for
      the greatest goal scorer for a single club by surpassing Brazilian legend
      Pelé, who scored 643 goals for Santos between 1956 and 1974. As of June
      22, Messi has netted 672 goals for Barca.
